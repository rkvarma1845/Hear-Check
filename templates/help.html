        <h1>Hearing Assessment Application - Help Page</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the <strong>Hearing Assessment Application</strong>! This tool helps you evaluate your hearing by playing a sound at various volumes and recording your ability to hear it. Follow the instructions below to complete the assessment.</p>

        <h2>How to Use the Application</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start the Hearing Assessment</strong>
                <p>On the homepage, click the <strong>"Start Hearing Assessment"</strong> button. You will be directed to the assessment page.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Enter Your Age</strong>
                <p>Once on the assessment page, you will be asked to provide your age. This helps us record your hearing results accurately.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Play the Sound</strong>
                <p>After entering your age, an audio player will appear. You can click the <strong>Play</strong> button to start the sound. The default volume of the sound is <strong>10%</strong>.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Adjust the Volume (Optional)</strong>
                <p>You can adjust the volume using the <strong>Increase Volume</strong> and <strong>Decrease Volume</strong> buttons. This allows you to manually change the volume if needed. The volume will be displayed as a percentage, ranging from <strong>0%</strong> to <strong>100%</strong>.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Respond to the Sound</strong>
                <p>Once you have heard the sound, respond by clicking either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Yes, I can hear</strong> – If you can hear the sound at the current volume.</li>
                    <li><strong>No, I cannot hear</strong> – If you cannot hear the sound.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Automatic Volume Increase</strong>
                <p>If you cannot hear the sound and the volume is below 100%, the application will automatically increase the volume by <strong>10%</strong>. The process will repeat until you either hear the sound or the volume reaches <strong>100%</strong>.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>View Your Results</strong>
                <p>If you can hear the sound and click <strong>Yes</strong>, you will be shown a message confirming that you can hear the sound. The volume and your age will be recorded. If the volume reaches 100% and you still cannot hear the sound, the application will suggest consulting a hearing specialist.</p>
